                    We start by meeting either at a cafe, office or just through skype depending on where we are the time. The purpose is to get to know each other and what our thoughts and expectations are.

                    After our chat, I'll return to you with a project summary documentation which walks you through the scope, timeline, technologies required, respnsibilities and remuneration of the project. Once it suits us both, we'll start.

                    This stage is very important, and is the first step for us to really get a feel for your new project. This is the stage where I'll prepare so called wireframes, blueprints, of your project.
                    After some iteration, when we both have a clear understanding of the fundamental structure, layout and design of the site we're ready to jump to the next phase.

                    At this stage you're finally going to see a functioning site, though not all of it. The purpose of this stage is to present a home page or main page design of your project.
                    Basically the 1-2 most important pages of the project will be designed and showcased on 1-2 different platforms such as general mobile and desktop screens. When we have a 
                    mutual understanding of your requests, I'll continue with the remaining pages.

                    This is the stage which will take the longest, and will be the most silent. This is where I basically go back to my desk and complete the rest of your project, until it's 
                    basically finished. We'll have 1-2 check-points along the way.

                    After some silence, since there is not too much to give feedback on in previous stage, we meet again, though this time we're really close to the finish line. This is the stage where we go through the site, all its functionalities, 
                    how it is used & maintained. If needed I can also provide training for off-site team members and provide with a short "users manual".

                    It's finished! This is the stage where it's time to launch the project and finally give over the steering wheel. Here I'll hand over all usernames & passwords to maintain the project.
                    It's also recommended that the project goes live for about 1 week before any heavy marketing is started, just to see that everything is working as it should.
